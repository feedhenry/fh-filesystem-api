fh-filesystem-api
==================

## Overview

The fh-filesystem-api is the API used by fh-forms SDK to perform file operations. It has been extracted to a separate module as it may be useful in other projects.

The idea is that it would be extended for use in other projects.

## TODO

- Tests
- Documentation
- File listing
- File Metadata saving
